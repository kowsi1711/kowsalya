            Do you know why i have given the name "The Unknown Puzzle" to my website? This is the thought that comes
            to everyone's mind when they hear my name.People say i am so weird. I think that they actually din't
            try to find the answer for the puzzle.

    <h2>&emsp;&emsp;Yeah i am a kind of person who is very normal and friendly to people who have a decent relationship with me but I am completely different in the views of my family
    and close friends I will be more like a stupidly idiotic creature. Yes i agree to them no issues. Whatever they say about me or how much hatred they pour on me it doesnt matters 
     because at the end of the they will give back double the amount of love.
      Without them i cant even imagine a single day. I will be the most craziest when i be with my friends.We  will be talking,giggling,fighting,dancing and do all dirty non-sense.
      We all unite just for two things one is food and the other is "boys...".

&emsp;&emsp;I think beauty is not something outside but its the reflection of your true self.Makeup can just hide your scars but it will not remove it. A true soul is 
    beautiful by heart which is reflected in the face.Everyone in this world are beautiful in their own way. Do love your self, beleive in you, keep up your promises,
    give love and get it back,be happy and spread it around then you will that one most beautiful person in others life.
